# Archive — Superseded Documents

**Documents that have been replaced by newer versions but are retained for reference.**

---

## Context

As the system evolved from InvestOS (single product) to CapitalOS (three-product platform) to the consolidated InvestOS operating system within the full Quantum Intelligence Engine, some documents were superseded. They live here for historical reference.

## Historical Context

The product evolution followed this path:

1. **InvestOS** (original) — Single fundraising infrastructure product
2. **CapitalOS** (interim) — Three-product umbrella: Capital Clarity, Capital Investment, Capital Deployment
3. **InvestOS** (current) — Consolidated operating system: InvestOS Clarity, InvestOS Capital, InvestOS Deployment

The CapitalOS strategic framework was absorbed into InvestOS, which is now QIE's sole commercial offering.
