# Archive — Superseded Documents

**Documents that have been replaced by newer versions but are retained for reference.**

---

## Context

As the system evolved from InvestOS (single product) to CapitalOS (three-product platform) to the full Quantum Intelligence Engine, some documents were superseded. They live here for historical reference.
