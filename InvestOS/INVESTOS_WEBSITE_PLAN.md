## 1. Project Goals & Context

### What We're Building

A professional consulting firm website for Light Brands Consulting. The site showcases our flagship service offering, InvestOS™ - a comprehensive fundraising infrastructure service that delivers in 14-30 days what traditionally costs $3.35M-$7.7M and takes 6-12 months.

This is a **consulting services website**, not a SaaS platform or product site. The website must:

1. **Sell and wow** visitors immediately with compelling value proposition
2. **Build credibility** through detailed service descriptions and proof points
3. **Qualify buyers** through interactive tools and self-identification
4. **Convert visitors** to consultation bookings and demo requests
5. **Speak to sophisticated buyers** (founders, CFOs, advisors evaluating $75K-$750K purchase)

### Target Audience

**Primary personas:**
- Technical founders raising first institutional round ($500K-$3M)
- Growth-stage CEOs raising Series A/B ($3M-$20M)
- Institutional-scale founders raising growth equity ($10M-$100M+)
- Advisory firms seeking production partners
- UHNW individuals deploying personal capital

### Core Value Propositions

1. **Speed:** 14-30 days vs. 6-12 months
2. **Cost:** $75K-$750K vs. $3.35M-$7.7M
3. **Integration:** 1 consulting firm vs. 8 fragmented vendors
4. **Quality:** Institutional-grade output through AI-augmented senior consultants
5. **Proof:** Sample deliverables, case studies, transparent methodology

## Appendix C: Open Questions for Team Review

1. **Content Creation:** Who will finalize the ~30,000 words of website copy? Should we hire a copywriter or adapt internally?

2. **Case Studies:** Do we have any client case studies ready to publish? If not, should we create anonymized examples or wait?

3. **Video Content:** Do we want explainer videos or founder testimonials? If yes, what's the production plan?

4. **CRM Integration:** Which CRM should we integrate with? (HubSpot, Salesforce, other?)

5. **Calendar Integration:** Should we use Calendly, or a different booking system?

6. **Budget:** What's the budget for:
   - Copywriter (if external): $5K-$15K
   - Video production (if desired): $10K-$30K
   - Photography (if needed): $3K-$10K
   - Email/CRM tools: $200-$500/month

7. **Launch Date:** Is there a hard deadline or event (conference, fundraise announcement) that determines launch timing?

8. **Legal Review:** Should legal review the content before launch (pricing claims, competitive comparisons)?
