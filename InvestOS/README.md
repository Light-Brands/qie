# InvestOS — Capital Investment Product Documentation

**The detailed offering, brand, and implementation documentation for QIE's fundraising infrastructure product.**

## Context Within QIE

InvestOS is the **documentation layer** for the **IOS (Capital Formation) module**. It contains the client-facing and internal specifications for the **Capital Investment** product — the middle tier of the [CapitalOS](../CapitalOS) product line.

```

    ├── Capital Clarity ($10K)
    ├── Capital Investment ($75K-$750K)  ← InvestOS documents this
    └── Capital Deployment ($100K-$5M)
```

The AI agents and workflows that *execute* InvestOS deliverables live in `_bmad/ios/` (the IOS module). This directory contains the *specifications* of what gets delivered.
