# InvestOS™ — The Operating System for High-Trust Investment Platforms

**Turn complexity into clarity in 14-30 days, not 6-12 months — at a fraction of the cost.**

## Executive Summary

InvestOS is a complete fundraising operating system that delivers everything founders need to raise institutional capital — strategy, financials, legal architecture, market research, operations, an interactive investor platform, and a ready-to-go data room — in one integrated engagement.

### The Problem

Founders raising $3M-$10M+ face a brutal paradox: you need to spend money to raise money. The traditional infrastructure required costs **$1.5M-$3M+** assembled piecemeal across 8+ separate firms over 6-12 months:

- Strategy consultancies for positioning ($150K-$300K)
- Law firms for entity structuring ($75K-$200K)
- Tax advisors for multi-jurisdiction optimization ($50K-$150K)
- Financial modelers for projections ($30K-$75K)
- Market researchers for competitive intelligence ($40K-$100K)
- Data room builders and document assemblers ($20K-$50K)
- Investor platform developers ($200K-$500K)
- Operational consultants for scaling blueprints ($100K-$300K)

By the time traditional firms finish discovery and alignment, the market has shifted. Capital windows close. Runway burns.

### The InvestOS Solution

We deliver the complete infrastructure in **14-30 days** at **$75K-$195K** — a 75-85% cost reduction with 10x faster delivery. One team. One engagement. One invoice.

**What Gets Delivered:**
- Strategic foundation and go-to-market positioning
- 12-tab variable-driven financial model with IPEV-compliant valuation
- Complete data room with 21+ investment documents
- Private Placement Memorandum and subscription agreements
- Market research and competitive intelligence
- Operational blueprint for scaling
- Interactive investor platform (custom-built)
