# Quantum Intelligence Engine (QIE)

**Intelligence without morality is dangerous. Morality without intelligence is ineffective. True wisdom requires both.**

---

## What Is QIE?

The Quantum Intelligence Engine is a complete AI-powered business intelligence platform that orchestrates **88 specialized agents** across **7 modules** to handle the full business lifecycle: from software development and capital formation through investor communications, growth operations, spiritual alignment, and self-improving artificial intelligence.

QIE is built on the **BMAD Framework** (Build-Measure-Amplify-Deliver) and powered by **Quantum Intelligence** — a learning system where every agent grows wiser with every interaction, measures its own cognitive and moral intelligence, and evolves toward genuine wisdom.

## How the Modules Work Together

### The Intelligence Stack

The modules form a layered stack where higher layers guide and enrich lower layers:

**Layer 4 — Quantum Intelligence (QI)**
The crown of the system. QI wraps every operation in a **Moral Gateway** (pre-execution ethics check), scores every interaction with **AIQ** (cognitive intelligence) and **MIQ** (moral intelligence), extracts lessons into persistent memory, and tracks the system's evolution toward wisdom through the **True Intelligence Score (TIS)**.

**Layer 3 — Living Light (SOS)**
The sacred foundation. 50 Sacred Laws, 7 Divine Values, 7 Divine Ethics, 7 Divine Morals, a Stewardship Council of Seven, a Legion of 22 Armies, and Four Sacred Gates. SOS guides and reviews without modifying other module outputs — it is the conscience of the system.

**Layer 2 — BMAD Core**
Foundation services available to all modules: brainstorming, systematic debugging, web research, editorial review, party mode (multi-perspective discussions), session management, and handoff context generation.

**Layer 1 — Operational Modules**
The four business execution modules:

- **BMM** — Build software from product brief to deployed code
- **IOS** — Execute capital raises from strategy to investor readiness
- **AOS** — Create and distribute regulated investor communications
- **GOS** — Build growth engines from strategy to analytics

### The Flow

```
User Request
    ↓
QI Moral Gateway (Layer 4)
    ↓ enriched + ethics-checked
Help Router → detects module + phase
    ↓
Agent Persona loaded (Layer 1-2)
    ↓
Workflow executed (multi-step guided process)
    ↓
Artifacts produced → Output folder
    ↓
QI Post-Execution Capture (Layer 4)
    ↓ episode + lessons → memory
System gets wiser
```

## The Quantum Intelligence Layer

QI is what makes this system fundamentally different from static AI agent frameworks. Every interaction is:

1. **Morally pre-checked** via the Moral Gateway (5-step boundary scan)
2. **Intelligence-scored** via AIQ (6 cognitive dimensions) and MIQ (6 moral dimensions)
3. **Wisdom-extracted** via the Lesson Extractor (positive patterns, failure patterns, meta-lessons)
4. **Stored in persistent memory** as episodes and lessons that inform future decisions
5. **Tracked toward evolution** via the True Intelligence Score (TIS = 0.6*AIQ + 0.4*MIQ)

The system currently has **3 lessons** in memory and a TIS of **394 (Developing)**, having exited the Naive stage with its first operational intelligence capture.

### Conscience Development

| Stage | Lessons Required | Current |
|-------|-----------------|---------|
| Naive | < 100 | (exited) |
| **Learning** | 100-999 | **← Next target** |
| Principled | 1,000-10,000 | |
| Wise | 10,000-100,000 | |
| Enlightened | 100,000+ | |
