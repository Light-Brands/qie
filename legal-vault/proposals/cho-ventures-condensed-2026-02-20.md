# THE FACE OF REGENERATIVE DEVELOPMENT

> **Prepared for:** Tony Cho
> **Date:** February 20, 2026
> **What we're solving:** Making Tony Cho the definitive category leader in Regenerative Development
> **The question:** Are you ready to own this category?

---

## 1. WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW

You've done the work nobody else has done.

Wynwood transformation. Regenerative placemaking. Community-driven development. Climate innovation hubs. Arts activation. Youth programming. Philanthropic infrastructure. Cultural preservation through real estate.

No one else operates across all of these dimensions with this level of authenticity and track record.

**You have the substance. You have the story. You have the vision.**

But if you asked the world "Who owns Regenerative Development as a category?" — the answer is: nobody.

Not you. Not anyone.

**The category is wide open.**

And here's what matters: the person who claims it first, who builds the visible ecosystem that proves the category exists, will define what this space looks like for the next decade.

That person should be you.

But right now, to the outside world, Cho Ventures looks like a collection of interesting projects, not the unified movement of someone who owns the category.

---

## 2. THE GAP: WHAT'S STANDING BETWEEN YOU AND CATEGORY OWNERSHIP

The gap is not the work. The gap is **visibility**.

Right now, you have 15+ entities operating independently:
- Tony Cho Personal Brand
- Future of Cities
- Metro 1 Commercial
- ChoZen Center
- Climate + Innovation HUB
- Cho Family Foundation
- Ximena Cho Legacy Fund
- Friends of PHXJAX
- And 7 more

Each one is real. Each one is meaningful.

But they're scattered across disconnected WordPress sites, Squarespace pages, Wix builders. Nothing talks to anything. There's no central narrative showing how it all connects.

**When people look at you, they see projects. They don't see a category.**

And that's the only thing standing between you and category ownership.

---

## 3. HOW WE PUT YOU THERE

The people who own categories don't get there by doing better work.

They get there by building ecosystems that make their work **impossible to ignore**.

Look at the names that own their spaces:
- **Vishen Lakhiani** built **Mindvalley** and became the **face of Personal Transformation**.
- Elon Musk built Tesla as the **face of sustainable transportation**.
- Yvon Chouinard built Patagonia and became the **face of environmental capitalism**.

They built visible, unified ecosystems that **proved the category existed** and showed who defined it.

**That's what we build for you.**

**ChoVerse is your Mindvalley.**

The platform that becomes living proof that Regenerative Development is a category, and Tony Cho is the person who owns it.

Not 15 disconnected projects. One movement. And you're the face of it.

## 4. THE STAGES: INFRASTRUCTURE IS EVERYTHING

### Stage 1: Foundation (Days 1-20)
Build ChoVerse Hub + Tony Personal Brand + Future of Cities

### Stage 2: Ecosystem Integration (Days 21-40)
Connect all 15 entities into the ChoVerse system

### Stage 3: Capital Readiness (Days 41-60)
Deploy InvestOS — make the ecosystem investable

### Stage 4: Activation (Day 61+)
Fire AmplifyOS — turn infrastructure into movement and capital

**Timeline:** 60 days to capital-ready. 12 weeks total to $12M raise readiness.

**Why infrastructure first?**

Because everything else is easy once you have the foundation. Marketing works when there's a system to capture it. Capital flows when there's infrastructure to trust. Momentum compounds when there's intelligence behind it.

**Without infrastructure:** Every initiative is a restart. Every dollar is diluted. Every opportunity is friction.

**With infrastructure:** Everything you do makes everything else stronger.

---

## 5. WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN YOU OWN THE CATEGORY

On the other side of this build:

**Conference organizers call you first.**
When regenerative development is the topic, your name is the first one mentioned. You're not on a panel. You're the keynote.

**Publications reference you as the authority.**
Articles on regenerative placemaking, climate-conscious real estate, community-driven development — they all mention Tony Cho. Not as an example. As the category definer.

**Investors know your name before they know your projects.**
When capital looks at this space, they start with you. Not because you pitched harder. Because the ecosystem shows them you're the one who defined the category.

**Every initiative you launch is amplified by the full ecosystem.**
When you release your book, ChoVerse pushes it to everyone following your work. When you launch a new development, the entire ecosystem reinforces the narrative. When you speak, the platform captures and distributes it.

**The $12M raise flows naturally.**
Because the infrastructure doesn't ask investors to connect the dots. It shows them the complete picture, with you at the center.

---

**From:** "Visionary developer with extraordinary projects"

**To:** "The face of Regenerative Development"

Not better projects. Better positioning.

## 6. THE DEAL TERMS

We heard you. You need to raise $12M. You want to pay us **out of the raise**, not out of pocket upfront.

**Why this deal is structured this way:**

Typically, we charge 30% upfront. This engagement is different.

We believe in you being the authority for regenerative development. The movement needs a leader who can take it where it needs to go. We want to help you get there. This is more mission than transaction for us.

**Let us help you become institutional-ready with your business and future.**

Here's the structure:

### Three Payment Options (Same Deliverables)

| | **CASH** | **BLEND** | **EQUITY** (Recommended) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Upfront** | $65K | $50K | **$40K** |
| **At $1.2M raised** | $292.5K | $225K | **$180K** |
| **At $3.6M raised** | $292.5K | $225K | **$180K** |
| **Total Cash** | $650K | $500K | **$400K** |
| **Equity** | $0 | $200K (0.57%) | **$400K (1.13%)** |
| **Total Value** | $650K | $700K | **$800K** |
| **Future Work** | Standard rates | At cost | **At cost** |
| **Partnership** | Ends at delivery | Ongoing | **Ongoing** |

### What You Get (All Options):

- ChoVerse superintelligence hub
- Tony Personal Brand platform
- Future of Cities institutional platform
- All 15 entity portals integrated
- InvestOS (capital readiness infrastructure)
- AmplifyOS (activation engine)
- 60-day build timeline
- $12M raise readiness

### Why We Recommend Equity-Aligned:

**$40K starts the entire build.**

- 90% of cash ($360K) only paid when the raise moves forward
- We take equity at pre-money valuation ($35.3M NAV)
- Equity only vests when the raise closes
- After this engagement, all future work is **at cost** — no margin, because we're invested in the outcome
- We stay committed as long-term partners, not a one-time vendor

**The economics:**
- $40K upfront = 0.33% of the $12M raise
- Total cash = $400K = 3.33% of the raise
- 90% deferred = we only get paid if you succeed

## 7. THE REAL QUESTION

This is not about whether we can build the infrastructure.

We can. We've done this for category leaders before. We know exactly how to position you as the face of Regenerative Development.

**The question is not whether we can put you there.**

**The question is whether you're ready to sit there.**

Are you ready to be the person whose name is synonymous with regenerative development?

Are you ready for every conference, every publication, every investor conversation in this space to start with you?

Are you ready to own this category?

If the answer is yes, we're here. We know how to build the ecosystem that makes it happen. And we're ready to take this journey with you.

---

## 8. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

You have the work. You have the track record. You have the vision.

We have the infrastructure that makes you the category owner.

**The timeline:** 60 days to build ChoVerse and position you as the face of Regenerative Development.

**The investment:** $40K to start. 90% deferred until the $12M raise moves forward.

**The outcome:** Category ownership. Not as a goal. As a reality.

---

We're not asking if you can afford this.

We're asking if you're ready to own this category.

**When you are, we're here.**

---

## NEXT STEP

Which path feels most aligned?

- **Option 2A:** $650K all cash, $65K upfront, standard engagement
- **Option 2B:** $500K cash + $200K equity, $50K upfront, at-cost future work, ongoing partnership
- **Option 2C:** $400K cash + $400K equity, $40K upfront, at-cost future work, deepest partnership alignment **(Recommended)**

All options: 90% deferred. We only get paid when the raise moves.
