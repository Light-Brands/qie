# Influex x Light Brands Partnership Vision

> **From**: Light Brands (Light Brand Consulting)
> **To**: Influex (Dmitriy Kozlov, CEO)
> **Date**: February 22, 2026
> **Type**: Strategic Technology Partnership
> **Status**: Partnership Vision, For Discussion

---

## The Vision

This is not a vendor engagement. This is a strategic partnership between two companies that believe in the same thing: **design-first, essence-driven brand experiences** delivered at a level the market has never seen.

Light Brands builds the most advanced AI-powered website and brand delivery platform in existence, purpose-built for Influex's methodology, clients, and growth. Influex gains a technology partner that follows every step of their process, from intake through delivery, and transforms a $100K/month WordPress burden into a high-margin, lightning-fast delivery engine.

In return, Influex promotes the Light Brands AI OS alongside their own services, opening a distribution channel into the most influential personal brands in the world.

**Both parties win when the other grows. That's the design.**

---

## Partnership Principles

| Principle | How It Shows Up |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Reciprocity** | Both parties share in each other's success through profit alignment, never extractive |
| **Sovereignty** | Each company remains independent. No equity changes hands. No control transferred. |
| **Transparency** | Revenue figures shared quarterly. Development costs tracked openly. |
| **Evolution** | The platform grows with Influex's needs. Major development continues at cost. |
| **Long-Term Alignment** | This is designed to last years, not quarters. |

### The Shift: Same Team. Same Seats. New Superpowers.

We don't fire anyone. We don't reduce headcount. **We upgrade every person in every seat into an AI-native strategist commanding their section of an intelligent army.**

The costs stay the same. The team stays the same. What changes is what each person can *do*.

> **KEY INSIGHT**: The team doesn't shrink. The team becomes DANGEROUS. Every person who was drowning in manual work now commands AI that does the manual work at 10x speed while they focus on what humans do best: taste, judgment, relationships, and creative direction.

### The Revenue Curve: What Happens When Capacity Unlocks

Today, Influex is capacity-capped. They literally cannot take more clients. The team is maxed out, every hour is spoken for, and every new project means someone works nights.

**When we plug in the AI-native platform, the capacity ceiling disappears.**

```

> **Platform goes live at M6 and capacity unlocks.** Team costs stay (same people, same seats). Infrastructure costs plummet as WordPress hosting, plugins, and maintenance are replaced by one platform at pennies per site. Revenue scales because the team can now serve 10x clients.

### The Numbers: Quarter by Quarter

| | **Today** | **Q1** | **Q2** | **Q3** | **Q4** | **Q5** | **Q6** |

| **Team Output** | 1x | 1.5x | 3x | 5x | 7x | 8x | 10x |

**What's happening in each quarter:**

**Q1: Foundation.** Platform is being built. Team starts learning AI-native workflows. WordPress still running. Revenue steady. Costs starting to drop as first efficiencies kick in.

**Q2: The Flip.** Platform goes live. First clients migrate. WordPress infrastructure starts shutting down. Team is now working in the new system, each person doing 3x what they did before. Revenue starts climbing as new capacity opens up. Profit doubles.

**Q3: Scale Begins.** Full migration complete. WordPress is gone. The team is fully AI-native with designers directing AI, developers building platform features, and strategists architecting brands at scale. New clients flowing in. Revenue hits $200K. Profit hits $120K/month.

**Q4: Acceleration.** Word spreads. Influex can now take on clients they used to turn away. Delivery in 1 to 2 weeks instead of 6 to 8. Premium pricing maintained because the quality is *better* and AI-native sites are faster, more accessible, and more optimized. Revenue hits $300K. Profit hits $213K.

**Q5 and Q6: The Empire.** Same core team. $400 to $500K/month in revenue. 80% margins. 1,200 to 2,000 sites on the platform. Every site built on Next.js/Node.js, meaning any client can evolve their website into a **full native app on the App Store** when they're ready. That's a whole new revenue tier Influex has never been able to offer.

### The App-Store Foundation

This is the part most people miss. We're not just replacing WordPress with a better website builder. We're building on **Next.js and Node.js**, the same technology stack that powers production apps at Netflix, Uber, and Airbnb.

## The Revenue Model

### The Core Philosophy: Profit Aligned Partnership

This is not a revenue extraction model. This is a **profit-sharing partnership** where Light Brands is directly rewarded for two things: **lowering Influex's costs** and **helping grow Influex's revenue**. Every dollar of cost we eliminate and every dollar of revenue we help generate increases the profit pool we both share in.

### Two Phases: Recoupment, Then Ongoing

```

### Phase A: Recoupment, Profit Split Weighted Toward Light Brands

Light Brands is investing the development capital upfront at partner cost basis. During recoupment, the profit split is **weighted in Light Brands' favor** until the full FMV of development is paid back.

**Two paths we could take:**

#### Option A: 80/20 (Light Brands 80% / Influex 20%)

The aggressive recoupment. Light Brands gets paid back fast, and the partnership shifts to the sustainable 10% model sooner.

| Quarter | Revenue | Costs | Profit | LB (80%) | Influex (20%) |
|---------|---------|-------|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Today** | $120K | $100K | $20K | $16K | $4K |
| **Q1** (building) | $120K | $95K | $25K | $20K | $5K |
| **Q2** (platform live) | $135K | $80K | $55K | $44K | $11K |
| **Q3** (scaling) | $200K | $80K | $120K | $96K | $24K |
| **Q4** (accelerating) | $300K | $87K | $213K | $170K | $43K |

| Recoupment Tracking | Amount |
|---------------------|--------|
| Total Platform Development FMV (at cost) | $250,000 (illustrative) |
| LB's 80% share accumulates fast | $20K to $44K to $96K to $170K/month |
| **Estimated Full Recoupment** | **Approximately Q2 to Q3 (3 to 5 months after launch)** |

**Why Influex still wins during 80/20**: Even at 20%, Influex's take goes from $4K to $11K to $24K to $43K/month, doubling their current profit within the first quarter of platform launch. And recoupment is done within a single quarter once revenue starts scaling, getting them to the 90/10 model fast.

#### Option B: 50/50 (Light Brands 50% / Influex 50%)

The balanced recoupment. Both parties split equally during payback. It feels fair, takes a bit longer, but Influex keeps more during the transition.

| Quarter | Revenue | Costs | Profit | LB (50%) | Influex (50%) |
|---------|---------|-------|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Today** | $120K | $100K | $20K | $10K | $10K |
| **Q1** (building) | $120K | $95K | $25K | $12.5K | $12.5K |
| **Q2** (platform live) | $135K | $80K | $55K | $27.5K | $27.5K |
| **Q3** (scaling) | $200K | $80K | $120K | $60K | $60K |
| **Q4** (accelerating) | $300K | $87K | $213K | $106.5K | $106.5K |

| Recoupment Tracking | Amount |
|---------------------|--------|
| Total Platform Development FMV (at cost) | $250,000 (illustrative) |
| LB's 50% share per quarter | $12.5K to $27.5K to $60K to $106.5K/month |
| **Estimated Full Recoupment** | **Approximately Q3 to Q4 (4 to 6 months after launch)** |

**Why this option works**: Influex keeps 50% from day one, going from $20K to $27.5K to $60K to $106.5K/month. The recoupment takes slightly longer but the optics are "equal partners sharing equally until the investment is repaid."

---

**How It Works (Both Options):**

1. Light Brands tracks all development hours at **partner cost basis** (not retail rates). This is the FMV of the work being built.
2. Profit is calculated as **Influex gross revenue minus operating costs** (defined and agreed upon at partnership signing).
3. During recoupment, profit is split with the **majority going to Light Brands** until the total FMV of development is fully recouped.
4. Both parties have full transparency into development costs, operating costs, revenue, and the recoupment balance.
5. Light Brands is incentivized to cut costs fast and grow revenue fast because that's how they get paid back.

*Once the FMV is fully recouped, the model shifts immediately to Phase B.*

### Phase B: Ongoing 90/10 Profit Split

**How It Works:**

1. Once development costs are fully recouped, the split shifts to **90/10** where Influex keeps 90% and Light Brands receives 10% of profit.
2. This 10% of profit includes:
   - **Full platform support** including maintenance, monitoring, and incident response
   - **Ongoing optimization** including performance tuning, security updates, and cost reduction
   - **Future major development** including new features, new capabilities, and platform expansion, all done at **cost basis** (partner rate, not retail)
3. This structure means Influex gets a permanent technology partner whose income *depends* on Influex being as profitable as possible.

**Example at Scale:**

| Influex Revenue | Costs (team + infra) | Profit | Influex (90%) | LB (10%) | What's Included |
|----------------|---------------------|--------|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| $200K/mo | $80K | $120K | $108K | $12K | Full support + dev at cost |
| $300K/mo | $87K | $213K | $191.7K | $21.3K | Full support + dev at cost |
| $500K/mo | $100K | $400K | $360K | $40K | Full support + dev at cost |

**Compare to today**: Influex currently keeps $20K/month in profit with a maxed-out team. Under this model, the same team (empowered by AI) generates **$108K to $360K/month** in take-home profit while Light Brands earns a meaningful, growing share that's directly tied to making Influex's team as powerful as possible.

*Light Brands grows when Influex grows. Light Brands grows when Influex's costs shrink. Every incentive is aligned.*

### Referral Revenue: Light Brands AI OS

**How It Works:**

1. Influex promotes the **Light Brands AI OS** (Clarity, Strategy, Invest, Amplify) to their network.
2. For every client that Influex refers who purchases any Light Brands AI OS service:
   - Influex receives **10% of the revenue generated from that deal**
   - This commission is for the **lifetime of the deal**, not a one-time fee
   - No cap on referrals or total commission
3. Attribution is tracked via referral codes, warm introductions, or mutual agreement on source.

**Example Scenario:**

| Referral | AI OS Deal Size | Influex Lifetime Commission |
|----------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Influex refers a coaching business | $50K/year AI OS engagement | $5,000/year to Influex, every year |
| Influex refers an entrepreneur network | $120K/year platform build | $12,000/year to Influex, every year |
| 10 referrals in Year 1 at avg $60K each | $600K total AI OS revenue | $60,000/year to Influex, ongoing |

*This creates a real revenue stream for Influex with zero additional work beyond making introductions.*

---

## Why This Works

### For Influex

| Benefit | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Platform worth $250K+ built with no upfront cash | Recouped through profit share over 4 to 7 months |
| Monthly profit goes from ~$5K to $100K+ | 20x profit improvement |
| Monthly costs drop from $100K to approximately $22K | Approximately $78K/month in savings |
| Profitable immediately even during recoupment | $17 to $42K/month (vs $5K today) |
| Keeps 90% of profit after short recoupment | Fair, sustainable long-term split |
| Capacity goes from 200 to 2,000+ sites | 10x growth potential unlocked |
| Permanent technology partner in the 10% | No separate support contracts |
| Future development at cost basis | Major features built affordably |
| 10% lifetime referral commission on AI OS | New revenue stream from introductions |
| No equity given up | Full ownership and sovereignty maintained |
| Partner is incentivized to cut their costs | Light Brands profits when Influex profits |

### The Math Works

**Influex's Perspective, The Full Picture:**

| | Today | Q2 (Recoup 80/20) | Q4 (Recoup 80/20) | Q5+ (Ongoing 90/10) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly Revenue | $120K | $135K | $300K | $400K |
| Monthly Costs | $100K | $80K | $87K | $94K |
| Monthly Profit | $20K | $55K | $213K | $306K |
| Influex Keeps | $20K | $11K (20%) | $43K (20%) | $275K (90%) |
| Same team? | Yes | Yes | Yes (+1 to 2) | Yes (+2 to 3) |

During the short recoupment phase, Influex's per-month take dips slightly below today at Q2, but by Q3 and Q4 their 20% slice is already **double** their current profit. Once recoupment is done, they're keeping $275K+/month. Same team. New superpowers.

**The bottom line**: Light Brands recoups its investment within a single quarter of scale. Influex goes from $20K/month profit with a maxed-out, exhausted team to **$275K+/month** with the same team empowered as AI-native strategists and the capacity to keep scaling toward $500K/month. The pie doesn't just get bigger. It gets **15x bigger**.

## Lane Protection: The Investment Raise Process

Influex is free to take their platform and capabilities in any direction they want. Brand development, design, content, apps, and growth strategy are all open with no restrictions. That's their world.

**The protected lane is the investment raise process.** Light Brands' AI OS (Clarity, Strategy, Invest, Amplify) encompasses brand, strategy, capital formation, and communications, but the protected application is specifically **how those capabilities serve the investment raise process**. That's Light Brands' domain.

### The Agreement

**Influex agrees:**
- Not to recreate, replicate, or compete with the Light Brands AI OS **as it applies to the investment raise process**, which includes all four products (Clarity, Strategy, Invest, Amplify) when used for capital formation, investor communications, raise positioning, investor facing brand development, financial modeling, fundraising execution, or any service specifically targeting the investment raise lifecycle
- To connect Light Brands to their investment networks and introduce deal flow opportunities

**Influex is free to:**
- Offer brand development, identity, and creative services (Clarity adjacent) for general business purposes
- Offer growth strategy and marketing services (Strategy adjacent) for general business purposes
- Build apps, products, and digital platforms in any vertical
- Take the AI-native platform capabilities in any direction they choose
- No restrictions outside the investment raise process

**Light Brands agrees:**
- To keep Influex connected to every deal closed through their referral via the 10% lifetime commission
- To continue building and supporting the AI-native platform as the partnership's technology backbone
- No restrictions on any Influex capability outside the investment raise domain

### Why This Works

The protection is specific to a *process*, not a broad category. Influex can do brand work, they just can't package it as "investor facing brand positioning for a capital raise." They can do strategy, they just can't package it as "raise strategy and investor narrative development." The investment raise lifecycle is a specialized market that requires securities knowledge, compliance awareness, and capital formation expertise. It's a different world from building websites for coaches.

**The flywheel**: When Influex's clients say "I want to raise capital" or "I need to talk to investors," that's a Light Brands referral. Influex earns 10% lifetime on every deal. They make more money sending those clients to Light Brands than they ever would trying to build investment raise capabilities from scratch.
