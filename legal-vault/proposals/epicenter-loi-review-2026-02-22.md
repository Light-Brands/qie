# LOI Review: Transformational Epicenter

**Date:** February 22, 2026
**Status:** Pre-Draft Review
**Purpose:** Flag gaps and recommendations before drafting the LOI

---

## Structure Summary

- $17.3M convertible note secured by first-position lien on real estate
- 9% simple interest, quarterly cash payments, 5-year maturity
- Converts into up to 49% equity across three entities
- Founder-controlled board (2 of 3 seats)
- 12-month early repayment right for founders
- 24-month cumulative default trigger

---

## Critical Gaps

### 1. Conversion Price is Undefined

The note says "up to 49%" but never defines at what price or under what conditions conversion occurs. This is the most important term in the deal and it is blank.

**Recommendation:** Fix conversion at 49% on election (making this a deferred equity deal) or define a formula. Remove "up to" unless there is a sliding scale tied to specific milestones.

### 2. Cash Flow vs Interest Timing

$389,250 quarterly interest starts no later than January 2027. Phase 1 requires renovation, licensing, and buildout. The business may not generate revenue by Q1 2027.

If it does not, interest payments come from the $4.9M non-real-estate portion of the investment. That is circular: the investor funds the company, the company pays the investor back with those funds.

**Recommendation:** Model the revenue timeline explicitly. If there is a gap, propose PIK (paid-in-kind) interest during pre-revenue months that converts to cash pay once operations generate sufficient revenue.

### 3. Early Repayment Right

Founders can repay $18.85M after 12 months and terminate all conversion rights. The investor gets 9% but loses all upside on a $17.3M risk.

This is a call option on the equity. The cost to buy back conversion rights is $1.55M (one year of interest). A sophisticated investor will flag this immediately.

**Recommendation:** Decide whether this is a feature or a negotiation chip. If you intend to keep it, expect the investor to counter with a conversion premium, a lockout period, or a minimum conversion floor.

## Secondary Gaps

| Issue | Detail | Recommendation |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| Anti-dilution | Not addressed. If new investors enter, does 49% dilute? | Define anti-dilution protection or explicitly state pro-rata rights |
| Information rights | Not mentioned | Include quarterly financials and annual audit rights |
| Tag-along / Drag-along | Missing | Standard for institutional deals. Include both |
| Lien release on conversion | Unclear if first-position lien releases when investor converts to equity | Specify full lien release upon conversion |
| Partial conversion | Can the investor convert part and keep the rest as secured debt? | Prohibit partial conversion or define mechanics clearly |
| Key person | No provisions if a founder exits | Include key person clause triggering investor protections |
| Non-compete | Not addressed | Standard for founders during note term |

---

## Default Trigger: 24 Months

Allowing 24 months of cumulative unpaid interest before default is unusually generous. Industry standard is 30-90 day cure periods.

**Recommendation:** This protects the company during ramp-up, which is defensible. But expect the investor's counsel to counter with a shorter trigger (90-180 days) plus a defined cure window. Have a fallback position ready.

---

## The $229M Valuation

At 49% conversion on $17.3M, the implied entry valuation is ~$35.3M. The projected 5-year enterprise value of $229M represents a 6.5x return.

Calling this "conservative" without a supporting model will invite scrutiny.

**Recommendation:** Include the financial illustration but label it "illustrative projections." Add a sensitivity table showing bear, base, and bull scenarios. Let the numbers speak. Remove the word "conservative."

## What Is Strong

- Real estate collateral with first-position lien provides genuine downside protection
- Three-entity structure is clean and allows independent exits per entity
- Board structure is clear with founder control and investor representation
- Advisory role is well-scoped as consultative, not operational
- Overall structure is institutional-grade and investor-friendly on security

---

## Resolution: Time-Based Declining Equity (Added Feb 22)

The conversion mechanics gap has been resolved with a time-based declining equity schedule, now incorporated into the LOI draft.

### Mechanism

- Full 49% conversion available for 12 months from funding
- After month 12, conversion equity declines proportionally as interest is paid
- Formula: Equity = (($17.3M - Cumulative Interest Paid) / $17.3M) x 49%
- Presented as a fixed schedule in the agreement for legal clarity

### Conversion Schedule

| Conversion Point | Cumulative Interest | Equity % | Multiple at $229M |
|---|---|---|---|
| Month 12 | $778,500 | 49.0% | 6.5x |
| Month 18 | $1,557,000 | 44.6% | 6.0x |
| Month 24 | $2,335,500 | 42.4% | 5.7x |
| Year 3 | $3,892,500 | 38.0% | 5.3x |
| Year 4 | $5,449,500 | 33.6% | 4.8x |
| Year 5 | $7,006,500 | 29.2% | 4.3x |

### Why This Works

**For the founders:** Creates urgency for conversion. Prevents the investor from holding a 5-year free option on 49% while collecting 9% interest. The equity premium reflects capital at risk, and as that risk decreases through interest payments, so does the premium.

**For the investor:** The mechanism is mathematically fair, not punitive. At every point on the schedule, conversion still yields a significantly higher return than interest-only (4.3x to 6.5x vs 1.4x). The investor is never disadvantaged by converting; they are simply rewarded more for converting earlier.

**For the deal:** The structure is clean to draft (one table), easy to understand, and institutionally credible. The formula provides the mathematical basis; the schedule provides the legal certainty.

### Drafting Recommendation

Use the **fixed schedule** in the definitive agreements, not the formula. The formula is the logic. The schedule is the law. If there is ever a dispute about payment timing or calculation, the schedule governs.

### Remaining Open Items

1. **Interest timing:** Can the business service $389,250/quarter by Q1 2027? Model the revenue timeline.
2. **Early repayment right:** Still active at month 12. The declining equity mechanism makes this less critical as a founder protection, but it remains a strong negotiation position.
3. **Governance at lower equity:** If the investor converts at 29% (Year 5), does a 3-seat board with one investor seat still make sense? Consider tying board representation to conversion equity threshold.
