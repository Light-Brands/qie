# LOI Review: Transformational Epicenter

**Date:** February 22, 2026
**Status:** Pre-Draft Review
**Purpose:** Flag gaps and recommendations before drafting the LOI

---

## Structure Summary

- $17.3M convertible note secured by first-position lien on real estate
- 9% simple interest, quarterly cash payments, 5-year maturity
- Converts into up to 49% equity across three entities
- Founder-controlled board (2 of 3 seats)
- 12-month early repayment right for founders
- 24-month cumulative default trigger

---

## Critical Gaps

### 1. Conversion Price is Undefined

The note says "up to 49%" but never defines at what price or under what conditions conversion occurs. This is the most important term in the deal and it is blank.

**Recommendation:** Fix conversion at 49% on election (making this a deferred equity deal) or define a formula. Remove "up to" unless there is a sliding scale tied to specific milestones.

### 2. Cash Flow vs Interest Timing

$389,250 quarterly interest starts no later than January 2027. Phase 1 requires renovation, licensing, and buildout. The business may not generate revenue by Q1 2027.

If it does not, interest payments come from the $4.9M non-real-estate portion of the investment. That is circular: the investor funds the company, the company pays the investor back with those funds.

**Recommendation:** Model the revenue timeline explicitly. If there is a gap, propose PIK (paid-in-kind) interest during pre-revenue months that converts to cash pay once operations generate sufficient revenue.

### 3. Early Repayment Right

Founders can repay $18.85M after 12 months and terminate all conversion rights. The investor gets 9% but loses all upside on a $17.3M risk.

This is a call option on the equity. The cost to buy back conversion rights is $1.55M (one year of interest). A sophisticated investor will flag this immediately.

**Recommendation:** Decide whether this is a feature or a negotiation chip. If you intend to keep it, expect the investor to counter with a conversion premium, a lockout period, or a minimum conversion floor.

## Secondary Gaps

| Issue | Detail | Recommendation |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| Anti-dilution | Not addressed. If new investors enter, does 49% dilute? | Define anti-dilution protection or explicitly state pro-rata rights |
| Information rights | Not mentioned | Include quarterly financials and annual audit rights |
| Tag-along / Drag-along | Missing | Standard for institutional deals. Include both |
| Lien release on conversion | Unclear if first-position lien releases when investor converts to equity | Specify full lien release upon conversion |
| Partial conversion | Can the investor convert part and keep the rest as secured debt? | Prohibit partial conversion or define mechanics clearly |
| Key person | No provisions if a founder exits | Include key person clause triggering investor protections |
| Non-compete | Not addressed | Standard for founders during note term |

---

## Default Trigger: 24 Months

Allowing 24 months of cumulative unpaid interest before default is unusually generous. Industry standard is 30-90 day cure periods.

**Recommendation:** This protects the company during ramp-up, which is defensible. But expect the investor's counsel to counter with a shorter trigger (90-180 days) plus a defined cure window. Have a fallback position ready.

---

## The $229M Valuation

At 49% conversion on $17.3M, the implied entry valuation is ~$35.3M. The projected 5-year enterprise value of $229M represents a 6.5x return.

Calling this "conservative" without a supporting model will invite scrutiny.

**Recommendation:** Include the financial illustration but label it "illustrative projections." Add a sensitivity table showing bear, base, and bull scenarios. Let the numbers speak. Remove the word "conservative."

## What Is Strong

- Real estate collateral with first-position lien provides genuine downside protection
- Three-entity structure is clean and allows independent exits per entity
- Board structure is clear with founder control and investor representation
- Advisory role is well-scoped as consultative, not operational
- Overall structure is institutional-grade and investor-friendly on security

---

## Three Decisions Needed Before Drafting

1. **Conversion mechanics:** Fixed 49% on election, or a formula? This must be defined.
2. **Interest timing:** Can the business service debt by Q1 2027? If not, propose a PIK structure.
3. **Early repayment right:** Keep it, modify it, or use it as a negotiation concession?

Once these are settled, the LOI can be drafted cleanly.
