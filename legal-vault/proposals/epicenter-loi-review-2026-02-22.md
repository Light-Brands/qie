# LOI Review: Transformational Epicenter

**Date:** February 22, 2026
**Status:** Pre-Draft Review
**Purpose:** Flag gaps and recommendations before drafting the LOI

---

## Structure Summary

- $17.3M convertible note secured by first-position lien on real estate
- 9% simple interest, quarterly cash payments, 5-year maturity
- Converts into up to 49% equity across three entities
- Founder-controlled board (2 of 3 seats)
- 12-month early repayment right for founders
- 24-month cumulative default trigger

---

## Critical Gaps

### 1. Conversion Price is Undefined

The note says "up to 49%" but never defines at what price or under what conditions conversion occurs. This is the most important term in the deal and it is blank.

**Recommendation:** Fix conversion at 49% on election (making this a deferred equity deal) or define a formula. Remove "up to" unless there is a sliding scale tied to specific milestones.

### 2. Cash Flow vs Interest Timing

$389,250 quarterly interest starts no later than January 2027. Phase 1 requires renovation, licensing, and buildout. The business may not generate revenue by Q1 2027.

If it does not, interest payments come from the $4.9M non-real-estate portion of the investment. That is circular: the investor funds the company, the company pays the investor back with those funds.

**Recommendation:** Model the revenue timeline explicitly. If there is a gap, propose PIK (paid-in-kind) interest during pre-revenue months that converts to cash pay once operations generate sufficient revenue.

### 3. Early Repayment Right

Founders can repay $18.85M after 12 months and terminate all conversion rights. The investor gets 9% but loses all upside on a $17.3M risk.

This is a call option on the equity. The cost to buy back conversion rights is $1.55M (one year of interest). A sophisticated investor will flag this immediately.

**Recommendation:** Decide whether this is a feature or a negotiation chip. If you intend to keep it, expect the investor to counter with a conversion premium, a lockout period, or a minimum conversion floor.

## Secondary Gaps

| Issue | Detail | Recommendation |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| Anti-dilution | Not addressed. If new investors enter, does 49% dilute? | Define anti-dilution protection or explicitly state pro-rata rights |
| Information rights | Not mentioned | Include quarterly financials and annual audit rights |
| Tag-along / Drag-along | Missing | Standard for institutional deals. Include both |
| Lien release on conversion | Unclear if first-position lien releases when investor converts to equity | Specify full lien release upon conversion |
| Partial conversion | Can the investor convert part and keep the rest as secured debt? | Prohibit partial conversion or define mechanics clearly |
| Key person | No provisions if a founder exits | Include key person clause triggering investor protections |
| Non-compete | Not addressed | Standard for founders during note term |

---

## Default Trigger: 24 Months

Allowing 24 months of cumulative unpaid interest before default is unusually generous. Industry standard is 30-90 day cure periods.

**Recommendation:** This protects the company during ramp-up, which is defensible. But expect the investor's counsel to counter with a shorter trigger (90-180 days) plus a defined cure window. Have a fallback position ready.

---

## The $229M Valuation

At 49% conversion on $17.3M, the implied entry valuation is ~$35.3M. The projected 5-year enterprise value of $229M represents a 6.5x return.

Calling this "conservative" without a supporting model will invite scrutiny.

**Recommendation:** Include the financial illustration but label it "illustrative projections." Add a sensitivity table showing bear, base, and bull scenarios. Let the numbers speak. Remove the word "conservative."

---

## What Is Strong

- Real estate collateral with first-position lien provides genuine downside protection
- Three-entity structure is clean and allows independent exits per entity
- Board structure is clear with founder control and investor representation
- Advisory role is well-scoped as consultative, not operational
- Overall structure is institutional-grade and investor-friendly on security

---

## Resolution: Time-Based Declining Equity (Added Feb 22)

The conversion mechanics gap has been resolved with a time-based declining equity schedule, now incorporated into the LOI draft.

### Mechanism

- Full 49% conversion available for 12 months from funding
- After month 12, conversion equity declines proportionally as interest is paid
- Formula: Equity = (($17.3M - Cumulative Interest Paid) / $17.3M) x 49%
- Presented as a fixed schedule in the agreement for legal clarity

### Conversion Schedule

| Conversion Point | Cumulative Interest | Equity % | Multiple at $229M |
|---|---|---|---|
| Month 12 | $778,500 | 49.0% | 6.5x |
| Month 18 | $1,557,000 | 44.6% | 6.0x |
| Month 24 | $2,335,500 | 42.4% | 5.7x |
| Year 3 | $3,892,500 | 38.0% | 5.3x |
| Year 4 | $5,449,500 | 33.6% | 4.8x |
| Year 5 | $7,006,500 | 29.2% | 4.3x |

### Why This Works

**For the founders:** Creates urgency for conversion. Prevents the investor from holding a 5-year free option on 49% while collecting 9% interest. The equity premium reflects capital at risk, and as that risk decreases through interest payments, so does the premium.

**For the investor:** The mechanism is mathematically fair, not punitive. At every point on the schedule, conversion still yields a significantly higher return than interest-only (4.3x to 6.5x vs 1.4x). The investor is never disadvantaged by converting; they are simply rewarded more for converting earlier.

**For the deal:** The structure is clean to draft (one table), easy to understand, and institutionally credible. The formula provides the mathematical basis; the schedule provides the legal certainty.

### Drafting Recommendation

Use the **fixed schedule** in the definitive agreements, not the formula. The formula is the logic. The schedule is the law. If there is ever a dispute about payment timing or calculation, the schedule governs.

### Remaining Open Items

1. **Interest timing:** Can the business service $389,250/quarter by Q1 2027? Model the revenue timeline.
2. **Early repayment right:** Still active at month 12. The declining equity mechanism makes this less critical as a founder protection, but it remains a strong negotiation position.
3. **Governance at lower equity:** If the investor converts at 29% (Year 5), does a 3-seat board with one investor seat still make sense? Consider tying board representation to conversion equity threshold.

---

## Structural Evaluation: Legal, Fairness, and Institutional Credibility

### Legally Clean

The declining equity mechanism is straightforward to draft. It uses a fixed schedule embedded in the agreement, not a floating formula requiring ongoing calculation. Key legal characteristics:

- **One table governs.** No ambiguity about what equity percentage applies at any conversion point. If a dispute arises, the schedule controls.
- **No subjective triggers.** The schedule is time-based, not milestone-based or performance-based. There is nothing to argue about.
- **Standard mechanics.** Convertible notes with time-based adjustments are well-established in institutional finance. This is not a novel or exotic instrument.
- **Clean conversion event.** Full conversion only (no partial). Lien releases completely. Equity replaces debt. No hybrid states.

The fixed schedule is preferable to the formula for definitive agreements. The formula provides the mathematical rationale. The schedule is the binding term.

### Structurally Fair

The mechanism passes the fairness test from both sides:

**Investor perspective:** At every point on the schedule, conversion yields a dramatically higher return than holding the note to maturity (4.3x to 6.5x vs 1.4x). The investor is never penalized for converting. They are rewarded more for converting sooner.

**Founder perspective:** The founders are not stripping value. They are pricing conversion equity against actual capital at risk. As the investor receives interest payments, their net exposure decreases. The equity adjustment reflects that reality.

**Neutral test:** If an independent financial advisor reviewed this structure on behalf of either party, the declining schedule would be seen as mathematically defensible and economically rational. Neither side is being squeezed.

### Institutionally Credible

This structure would hold up in front of sophisticated capital:

- The implied entry valuation (~$35.3M) is anchored to the real estate asset, not speculative projections
- The 9% coupon with first-position lien provides genuine downside protection independent of conversion
- The three-entity structure allows independent valuation and exit paths per entity
- The declining equity schedule is the kind of mechanism institutional investors and their counsel encounter regularly
- The "interest-only" return of 1.4x over 5 years, while modest, confirms the investor is never underwater even without conversion

## Risk Analysis

### 1. Investor Resistance

**Risk level: Moderate**

The most likely pushback points:

| Pushback | Likelihood | Response |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| "The equity reduction is too aggressive" | Medium | Show the math: even at Year 5, conversion returns 4.3x. The reduction reflects paid interest, not a penalty. |
| "I want the full 49% window extended to 18 or 24 months" | High | This is a reasonable negotiation point. Extending to 18 months costs the founders ~4.4 percentage points of equity protection. Consider this as a concession chip. |
| "The early repayment right at month 12 is a dealbreaker" | Medium | The declining equity mechanism reduces the strategic importance of the repayment right. Consider removing it as a goodwill gesture, or extending the trigger to 18 months. |
| "I want partial conversion rights" | Low-Medium | Resist this. Partial conversion creates a hybrid creditor-owner that complicates governance, future fundraising, and exit mechanics. Full conversion or full repayment is cleaner for both parties. |

**Mitigation:** Present the declining equity schedule as the investor-friendly alternative to a hard conversion deadline. Frame it as "you always have the right to convert, and it always makes economic sense to convert." The schedule protects the founders from indefinite optionality while preserving the investor's upside at every point.

### 2. Complexity

**Risk level: Low**

The structure is one table. Anyone who can read a spreadsheet can understand it. Compare this to:

- Milestone-based conversion (requires defining, measuring, and auditing milestones)
- Valuation-cap conversion (requires future valuation events)
- SAFE notes with MFN provisions (requires tracking multiple instruments)

The fixed schedule is simpler than all of these. The underlying formula is one line of arithmetic. This is not a complexity risk.

### 3. Governance Friction

**Risk level: Moderate at lower equity levels**

The current governance structure gives the investor one of three board seats regardless of equity percentage. This creates a potential mismatch:

| Conversion Point | Equity % | Board Representation | Mismatch? |
|-----------------|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| Month 12 | 49% | 1 of 3 seats (33%) | Investor underrepresented |
| Month 24 | 42.4% | 1 of 3 seats (33%) | Roughly proportional |
| Year 3 | 38.0% | 1 of 3 seats (33%) | Roughly proportional |
| Year 5 | 29.2% | 1 of 3 seats (33%) | Investor overrepresented |

**Recommendation:** Consider a governance threshold. If conversion equity falls below 35%, the investor retains a board observer seat (voice, no vote) rather than a full voting seat. This maintains the relationship while keeping governance proportional.

### 4. Future Fundraising Implications

**Risk level: Moderate**

A 49% equity holder (or even a 29% holder) creates dynamics that future investors will evaluate:

- **Dilution mechanics are undefined.** If a Series A investor wants 20%, does it come pro-rata from founders and Pablo, or only from founders? This must be addressed.
- **Control premium.** At 49%, founders hold 51%. Any future equity issuance could tip control to Pablo plus new investors. Future investors will model this.
- **Information rights and consent rights** granted to Pablo may conflict with what a future lead investor expects.

**Recommendation:** Include anti-dilution and pro-rata rights in the definitive agreements. Define how future capital raises affect all parties. A preemptive rights clause gives Pablo the right to participate in future rounds to maintain his percentage, which protects him without creating a governance deadlock.

## Refined Structure Recommendation

The current structure is strong. The following refinements maximize five factors simultaneously:

### 1. Investor Downside Protection (Already Strong)

No changes needed. The first-position lien on real estate, 9% coupon, and quarterly cash interest provide institutional-grade downside protection. Even the no-conversion scenario returns 1.4x. This is the deal's anchor.

### 2. Founder Control Stability (Needs One Adjustment)

**Current:** Founders hold 2 of 3 board seats and managing member authority.

**Refinement:** Add a governance threshold. If the investor converts at an equity level below 35%, their board seat converts to an observer seat. This prevents a scenario where a 29% equity holder has 33% voting power on the board. The investor retains visibility and voice; the founders retain proportional control.

### 3. Urgency for Conversion (Already Strong)

The declining equity schedule creates natural urgency without coercion. The investor's optimal move at every point is to convert. Waiting costs equity but gains interest income. The tradeoff is transparent and fair. No changes needed.

### 4. Fair Economic Alignment (Needs Two Adjustments)

**Adjustment 1: PIK interest during pre-revenue.**
If the business cannot service $389,250/quarter by January 2027, the interest should accrue as paid-in-kind (added to principal) until operations generate sufficient cash flow. This prevents the circular dynamic of the investor funding their own interest payments.

PIK interest would increase the principal balance, which slightly affects the declining equity calculation. Define in the agreement whether PIK interest is treated as additional principal for conversion purposes (increasing the investor's equity on conversion) or excluded from the conversion calculation (keeping the schedule fixed). The cleaner approach is to keep the fixed schedule and treat PIK separately.

**Adjustment 2: Extend the full conversion window to 18 months.**
Twelve months from funding to conversion decision is tight, especially if Phase 1 operations have not launched. The investor may want to see initial performance data before committing to permanent equity. Extending to 18 months costs the founders 4.4 percentage points of equity protection at the margin but significantly increases the investor's comfort level. This is a high-value concession at low cost.

### 5. Long-Term Partnership Durability (Needs Two Adjustments)

**Adjustment 1: Define future fundraising mechanics now.**
Include a pro-rata rights clause and a clear dilution framework in the definitive agreements. If the venture raises additional capital, all equity holders dilute proportionally unless they exercise preemptive rights. This removes a source of future friction before it materializes.

**Adjustment 2: Add a key person clause.**
If either founder exits the venture, the investor's protections should escalate: accelerated conversion rights, accelerated repayment, or enhanced governance rights. This is standard for a deal of this size and protects the relationship by making explicit what both parties already assume.

### Summary of Recommended Refinements

| Refinement | Benefits | Cost to Founders |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Governance threshold at 35% equity | Prevents disproportionate board power at low equity | None at high equity levels |
| PIK interest during pre-revenue | Eliminates circular funding, honest cash flow | Slightly higher principal balance |
| Extend full conversion window to 18 months | Higher investor comfort, better data for conversion decision | 4.4 percentage points of equity protection |
| Pro-rata rights and dilution framework | Removes future friction, standard institutional term | Shared dilution on future raises |
| Key person clause | Protects investor if a founder exits, standard at this deal size | Imposes obligations on founders to stay engaged |

### Why This Structure Is Superior

The core deal is already well-designed. The declining equity schedule solved the most critical gap. These five refinements address the remaining negotiation pressure points before the investor's counsel raises them.

The goal is not to extract maximum leverage. It is to present a structure where the investor's legal and financial advisors say: "This is fair, this is clean, and this is standard." When both sides feel protected, the deal closes faster, the relationship starts stronger, and the partnership scales without structural friction.

A deal that feels balanced on day one is a deal that survives year five.
