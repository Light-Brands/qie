# TRANSFORMATIONAL EPICENTER
## Master Global Structure Strategy

## Preamble: A Collective Mission

This document is not a defensive legal architecture designed to protect parties from each other. It is a structural blueprint for a shared mission.

Pablo, Nicholas, and Jason are building the Transformational Epicenter together: a luxury medical retreat, a clinical operating platform, and an AI-powered health intelligence system that will generate one of the most valuable neurological datasets in the world. Pablo brings capital, medical infrastructure expertise, and strategic depth. Nicholas and Jason bring the vision, the clinical model, the technology architecture, and the operational capacity to execute.

The structure below is designed to serve that mission. Every entity, every jurisdiction choice, every tax flow decision answers the same question: *Does this help us build the Transformational Epicenter faster, protect it better, and scale it further?*

Where choices exist between simplicity and marginal optimization, this document recommends simplicity. Where complexity materially improves protection or tax outcome, it is included and explained. Nothing here is designed to be clever. Everything is designed to be clean, defensible, and durable.

## 1. Recommended Optimal Global Structure

### The Architecture: Modified Option B (Single HoldCo, Three Operating Entities)

After evaluating Options A, B, and C from the structuring brief, the recommended architecture is a **single Cayman Islands holding company** with three subsidiary entities: a Mexico PropCo, a Mexico OpCo, and a Cayman IP/Data Co.

This combines Option B's simplicity (one investment entry point, one HoldCo, one cap table) with Option A's critical insight (the IP and data asset must be separated from Mexican operations).

### Why This Structure

**Single HoldCo** because:
- Pablo makes one investment into one entity. One cap table. One set of governance documents.
- The convertible note (per the existing LOI) is issued by the HoldCo. Clean and unambiguous.
- The 49/51 ownership split is maintained at the HoldCo level, automatically flowing to all subsidiaries.
- There is one investor, not a fund with multiple LPs. Multiple offshore HoldCos (Option A) are over-engineered for this situation.

**Three operating entities** because:
- The real estate, the operations, and the IP are fundamentally different asset classes with different risk profiles, valuation drivers, and exit timelines.
- Medical malpractice liability in Mexico OpCo should never reach the real estate or the data.
- Each entity can be valued, financed, or exited independently. Entity A could be sold to a real estate fund. Entity C could be spun into a health-data platform company. Entity B could be licensed to operators in other markets.
- This is exactly the three-entity structure already defined in the LOI. The global structure strategy now defines *where* each entity lives and *how* they interact.

**IP/Data Co in Cayman (not Mexico)** because:
- The data and IP are the most valuable long-term assets. Over 5 years, the brain data, biomarkers, and AI models could be worth more than the real estate and operations combined.
- Holding IP in Mexico exposes it to Mexican judicial process, regulatory seizure risk, and operational creditors.
- Cayman provides zero local tax, strong asset protection, and the IP entity can license to future operations in other countries without restructuring.
- The data never physically resides in Mexico. It is processed and stored on cloud infrastructure controlled by the Cayman IP entity. Mexico OpCo collects data under license and transmits it to the IP entity.

## 2. Jurisdiction Rationale

### Cayman Islands (HoldCo and IP/Data Co)

**Selected for:** Master holding company and intellectual property entity.

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| Tax | Zero income tax, zero capital gains tax, zero withholding tax. Tax exemption certificate available for 20+ years. |
| Investor credibility | The gold standard for international investment structures. Every major PE fund, hedge fund, and institutional investor recognizes Cayman. Pablo's counsel will not need to explain the jurisdiction. |
| CFC avoidance | With Pablo at 49% (the only U.S. shareholder) and total U.S. ownership below 50%, the HoldCo is **not** a Controlled Foreign Corporation under IRC Section 957. This is the critical structural advantage of the 49/51 split. |
| PFIC management | Requires active structuring (see Section 4) but manageable with proper substance. |
| IP protection | Strong intellectual property regime. No forced IP disclosure. No requirement to register locally to maintain protection. |
| Legal framework | English common law. Well-developed body of corporate law. Efficient court system with experienced judges. |
| Asset protection | Robust. Cayman entities are difficult to pierce from foreign jurisdictions. |
| BEPS compliance | Cayman has committed to OECD BEPS standards and exchanges information under CRS. This is a feature, not a bug. It means the structure passes scrutiny. |

**Why not Cook Islands for HoldCo?** The Cook Islands offer superior asset protection (virtually impossible to enforce foreign judgments), but this level of protection signals defensiveness to institutional investors and regulators. Cayman provides strong protection with institutional credibility. Cook Islands is appropriate for Jason's personal holding structure but not for the investment vehicle itself.

**Why not Panama for HoldCo?** Panama is appropriate for Nicholas's personal foundation structure but lacks Cayman's institutional credibility with U.S. investors and has weaker regulatory infrastructure. Panama also has limited tax treaty network, though this is equally true of Cayman.

**Why not Delaware?** A Delaware LLC or corporation is transparent and credible to U.S. investors, but it creates U.S. tax nexus. If the HoldCo is a Delaware entity, all income flows through to U.S. tax obligations for Pablo. The Cayman structure allows lawful deferral of U.S. taxation until repatriation (distributions or sale). For a 5-7 year investment horizon with projected significant appreciation, this deferral is material.

### Mexico (PropCo and OpCo)

**Selected for:** Real estate holding and clinical operations.

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| Legal requirement | The property is in Tulum, within Mexico's restricted zone (50km from coastline). Foreign entities cannot directly own real estate. A Mexican entity holding through a fideicomiso (bank trust) is required. |
| Operational necessity | Clinical services must be delivered by a Mexican entity with Mexican medical licenses, Mexican-employed medical staff, and Mexican regulatory compliance. There is no alternative jurisdiction for the OpCo. |
| Tax | Mexican corporate income tax is 30%. This applies to OpCo's net income and PropCo's rental income or capital gains. |
| Transfer pricing | Mexican SAT (tax authority) has adopted OECD transfer pricing guidelines. All intercompany transactions must be at arm's length with supporting documentation. |

                                   on royalties
```

### Tax Impact by Entity

| Entity | Gross Income | Key Deductions | Tax Rate | Effective Tax |
|--------|-------------|---------------|----------|---------------|
| Mexico OpCo | Service fee ($8,400-$9,800/guest/week) | Staff, facility, consumables, local admin, depreciation | 30% Mexican corporate | 30% on net income |
| Cayman IP Co | Royalty income ($1,400-$2,800/guest/week, net of 25% withholding) | Platform development, AI infrastructure, data storage, R&D | 0% Cayman | 0% (but 25% already withheld by Mexico) |
| Cayman HoldCo | Retained margin ($1,400-$3,800/guest/week) | Management costs, Pablo's interest payments, professional fees | 0% Cayman | 0% |

### Transfer Pricing Framework

**Critical:** The margin allocation between entities must be defensible under OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and Mexican law. The following principles govern:

1. **Mexico OpCo must receive arm's length compensation** for all functions performed, assets used, and risks borne. OpCo employs the medical staff, operates the facility, holds the medical licenses, manages patient care, and bears operational and regulatory risk. The service fee to OpCo should reflect this.

2. **The recommended OpCo margin is 60-70% of gross revenue.** A transfer pricing study (strongly recommended from a Big 4 or recognized TP firm) will establish the precise benchmark, but 60-70% is defensible given OpCo's functional profile as a full-function service provider with significant risk.

3. **IP royalty of 10-20% of revenue** is supportable for a licensed brand, proprietary treatment protocols, platform technology, and AI analytics. This requires documentation of the IP's development cost, uniqueness, and contribution to the business.

4. **The remaining 10-30% retained by HoldCo** compensates for entrepreneurial risk, capital deployment, marketing, platform operation, and management oversight. This margin requires that HoldCo demonstrate genuine economic substance (see Section 9).

**Warning:** An aggressive 50/50 split (as mentioned in the initial brief) will not survive scrutiny by Mexican SAT. The economic value creation is predominantly in Mexico (medical staff, facility, patient care, regulatory compliance). A defensible split requires proper documentation and a credible functional analysis.

### Pablo's U.S. Tax Position

| Scenario | Tax Treatment | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| While note is outstanding | Interest income taxed as ordinary income | Pablo reports 9% annual interest as income in the year received |
| After conversion (HoldCo is not CFC) | No current U.S. tax on undistributed earnings | Pablo is taxed only when he receives distributions or sells |
| PFIC management | See Section 9 | Requires annual PFIC determination and potentially QEF election |
| Distributions received | Taxed as ordinary income or qualified dividends | Depends on characterization; Cayman dividends generally not "qualified" |
| Exit / sale of shares | Capital gains | Long-term rate if held >1 year |

### Tax Optimization Summary

| Tax Reduction Mechanism | Estimated Impact | Legal Basis |
|------------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Cayman HoldCo (no corporate tax on retained earnings) | 21-30% savings on offshore margin | Standard international holding structure |
| IP licensing from Cayman (0% Cayman tax on royalties received) | Net 75% retention on royalty stream (25% Mexico WHT) | IP holding in zero-tax jurisdiction |
| Deferral of U.S. tax for Pablo (non-CFC structure) | Significant — taxes deferred until distribution or exit | IRC Section 957 — HoldCo is not a CFC with 49% U.S. ownership |
| Fideicomiso structure for RE | Avoids double taxation on property gains | Mexican bank trust holding for restricted zone property |
| PIK interest during pre-revenue | No cash outflow during buildout period | Contractual term in convertible note |

## 4. IP and Data Protection Architecture

### Why This Is the Most Important Section

The Transformational Epicenter's real estate will appreciate. Its clinical operations will generate cash flow. But the **neurological dataset and AI platform** will define the enterprise's long-term value.

Over five years, the venture will accumulate:
- 5,000+ ibogaine-related brain scan and neurological data reports
- Comprehensive biomarker, metabolic, and epigenetic datasets
- Longitudinal patient outcome data (pre-treatment, post-treatment, 6-month, 12-month follow-up)
- AI-enhanced treatment optimization models
- Proprietary clinical protocols

This dataset is unprecedented. No other entity on earth will have a comparable longitudinal ibogaine neurological dataset at this scale. The pharmaceutical, biotech, and AI health companies that will want access to this data in 5-10 years do not yet know this dataset exists.

The IP architecture must protect this asset absolutely.

### IP Entity Design

**Entity:** Cayman IP/Data Co (Exempted Company, 100% owned by Cayman HoldCo)

**Holds:**
- All intellectual property (trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, provisional patents)
- The technology platform and mobile application (source code, infrastructure)
- All AI models and machine learning algorithms
- All clinical treatment protocols (documented as proprietary trade secrets)
- The master neurological and biomarker dataset
- All licensing agreements with third parties

**Licenses to Mexico OpCo:**
- Right to use the platform for guest booking, intake, and management
- Right to apply proprietary treatment protocols
- Right to use the brand name and trademarks
- Right to collect data on behalf of IP Co under defined data processing agreements

**Does NOT license to Mexico OpCo:**
- Ownership of the data (IP Co owns; OpCo is a processor)
- Right to sublicense to third parties
- Right to modify protocols without IP Co approval
- Any rights that survive termination of the license agreement

### Data Sovereignty Architecture

```
PATIENT CONSENT
(Informed consent under Mexican law + international standards)
         │
         ▼
MEXICO OPCO (Data Collector / Processor)
- Collects biometric and clinical data during treatment
- Acts as data processor under license from IP Co
- Does NOT own the data
- Transmits encrypted data to cloud infrastructure
         │
         ▼
CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE (Controlled by IP Co)
- Hosted on AWS/Azure/GCP in jurisdiction selected by IP Co
- NOT hosted in Mexico (avoids Mexican judicial seizure)
- Encrypted at rest and in transit
- Access controlled by IP Co
         │
         ▼
CAYMAN IP/DATA CO (Data Controller / Owner)
- Legal owner of all aggregated, anonymized datasets
- Controls all access, licensing, and monetization decisions
- Maintains the AI models and analytical platforms
- Enters into research partnerships and licensing deals
```

### Data Compliance Framework

| Jurisdiction | Applicable Law | Key Requirements | Status |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| Mexico | Ley Federal de Proteccion de Datos Personales en Posesion de los Particulares (LFPDPPP) | Privacy notice, consent, purpose limitation, security measures, data transfer notice | Must comply for data collected in Mexico |
| United States | HIPAA (if treating U.S. patients) + state privacy laws | Protected health information standards, minimum necessary rule, business associate agreements | Applies to health data of U.S. persons; IP Co should implement HIPAA-equivalent controls regardless |
| Canada | PIPEDA | Consent, purpose limitation, accountability | Applies if Canadian guests are served |
| European Union | GDPR | Explicit consent, data minimization, right to erasure, cross-border transfer mechanisms | Applies if EU residents are guests; implement as baseline standard |

**Recommendation:** Design the data governance framework to GDPR standard from day one, regardless of guest nationality. GDPR is the strictest regime and meeting it satisfies all other jurisdictions. This is not over-engineering — it is building a dataset that can be licensed to any entity in any jurisdiction without remediation.

### The Sacred Dimension of Data Governance

This section goes beyond legal compliance.

The people generating this data are undergoing ibogaine-assisted therapy — one of the most neurologically and emotionally vulnerable states a human being can experience. The brain data collected during and after treatment reveals intimate details about their neurology, psychology, and health.

The data governance framework must honor the principle that **this data belongs first to the human being who generated it, and the venture holds it in trust.**

Recommended principles (to be embedded in the data processing agreements and patient consent forms):

1. **Informed consent must be genuine.** Consent forms should be reviewed during intake when the patient is sober and oriented, not during or after treatment.
2. **Patients retain the right to withdraw their data** from the aggregated dataset at any point, subject to technical feasibility of extraction.
3. **Anonymization must be irreversible** before any data is used for AI training, research partnerships, or third-party licensing.
4. **No data monetization that the patient would not consent to if asked.** This is a higher standard than legal compliance. It is a moral standard.
5. **Annual ethics review** of all data licensing agreements by an independent advisory board.

These principles do not conflict with the commercial value of the dataset. They enhance it. A dataset collected under the highest ethical standards, with ironclad consent and governance, is *more* valuable to pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, and AI health platforms than data collected under questionable practices.

### Enterprise Valuation Implications

The IP entity's separate existence enables:

| Valuation Event | Enabled By Separation | Estimated Impact |
|----------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Independent IP valuation for future fundraising | Yes — IP Co can be valued separately from RE and OpCo | Enables IP-specific investors (biotech VCs, health-tech funds) |
| Data licensing revenue | Yes — IP Co can license to third parties globally | Recurring high-margin revenue stream |
| Research partnerships with universities and pharma | Yes — IP Co contracts directly | Revenue + credibility + publication pipeline |
| Spin-off or IPO of data/AI platform | Yes — IP Co can be taken public or sold independently | Potential 10-50x multiple on a unique neurological dataset |
| Cross-border expansion | Yes — IP Co licenses to new facilities without restructuring | Each new geography is a license deal, not an entity restructure |

---

## 5. Real Estate Structuring Strategy

### The Restricted Zone Constraint

Tulum is within 50 kilometers of Mexico's coastline, placing it in the constitutional "restricted zone" where foreign entities and individuals cannot directly own real estate. This is not negotiable — it is embedded in Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution.

### Recommended Structure: Mexico PropCo via Fideicomiso

```
CAYMAN HOLDCO (100% shareholder)
         │
         ▼
MEXICO PROPCO (S.A. de C.V.)
- Mexican corporation, 100% owned by Cayman HoldCo
- Registered with RNIE (National Foreign Investment Registry)
         │
         ▼
FIDEICOMISO (Bank Trust)
- Mexican bank serves as trustee (e.g., Bancomext, BBVA, Santander)
- PropCo is the beneficiary of the trust
- Trust holds legal title to the property
- 50-year term, renewable
- PropCo has full rights: use, enjoyment, development, sale
```

### Why This Structure

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| Legal compliance | Satisfies Article 27 restricted zone requirements. The fideicomiso is the standard mechanism used by virtually all foreign-owned hospitality and residential developments in coastal Mexico. |
| Foreign investment registration | Required under Mexico's Foreign Investment Law. PropCo must register with RNIE and notify the National Foreign Investment Commission. Routine process. |
| Investor lien | The investor's first-position lien attaches to PropCo's beneficial interest in the fideicomiso. This is structurally identical to a mortgage on the property — the trust beneficiary rights are the economic equivalent of ownership. Mexican law recognizes security interests in fideicomiso beneficial rights. |
| Liability isolation | PropCo's sole asset is the property (via the fideicomiso). Operational liability from Mexico OpCo cannot reach PropCo because they are separate entities. |
| Exit | The property can be sold by transferring PropCo shares (avoids Mexican real estate transfer tax on certain structures) or by instructing the fideicomiso trustee to sell the property. PropCo can also be sold independently of OpCo and IP Co. |

### Property Acquisition Mechanics

1. **Cayman HoldCo capitalizes Mexico PropCo** (equity contribution from HoldCo to PropCo)
2. **PropCo establishes fideicomiso** with a Mexican bank (trustee)
3. **PropCo acquires the property** through the fideicomiso
4. **Acquisition costs:** Real estate transfer tax (2-4.5% depending on Quintana Roo rates), fideicomiso establishment fee, notary fees, appraisal, RNIE registration
5. **Estimated closing costs:** $400,000-$600,000 on a $12.4M acquisition (budget $550,000)

### Investor Lien Mechanics

Pablo's first-position lien (as defined in the LOI) will attach to:
- PropCo's beneficial interest in the fideicomiso (the primary security)
- Potentially, a pledge of the HoldCo's shares in PropCo (additional security layer)

This provides two layers of security:
1. **Direct claim on the property** through the fideicomiso beneficial interest
2. **Structural claim** through the share pledge — if needed, Pablo can enforce by taking ownership of PropCo shares, thereby controlling the fideicomiso beneficiary

Mexican counsel must draft the security documents under Mexican law. The fideicomiso trustee bank must acknowledge and consent to the lien.

---

## 6. Investor Entry and Capital Stack Model

### Capital Stack

| Layer | Amount | Purpose | Security |
|-------|--------|---------|----------|
| Senior Secured Note (Pablo) | $17,300,000 | Full venture capitalization | First-position lien on property + share pledge |
| Founder Equity (Nicholas + Jason) | Sweat equity + existing IP + operational capability | Vision, execution, management | Majority ownership (51%) and management authority |
| **Total Capitalization** | **$17,300,000 cash + founder contribution** | | |

### Fund Allocation

| Category | Amount | % of Total | Entity |
|----------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Property acquisition | $12,400,000 | 71.7% | Mexico PropCo |
| Closing costs and fees | $550,000 | 3.2% | Mexico PropCo |
| Entity formation and legal structuring | $350,000 | 2.0% | Cayman HoldCo (distributed) |
| Medical licensing and permits | $200,000 | 1.2% | Mexico OpCo |
| Renovation and medical facility buildout | $2,000,000 | 11.6% | Mexico PropCo / OpCo |
| Technology platform development | $500,000 | 2.9% | Cayman IP Co |
| Working capital (Phase 1 launch) | $800,000 | 4.6% | Mexico OpCo |
| Contingency reserve | $500,000 | 2.9% | Cayman HoldCo |
| **Total** | **$17,300,000** | **100%** | |

### Convertible Note Terms (Summary from LOI)

The investment enters as a Convertible Promissory Note with the following key terms (fully defined in the executed LOI):

- **Principal:** $17,300,000
- **Interest:** 9% simple, quarterly cash payments (PIK during pre-revenue)
- **Security:** First-position lien on real estate
- **Conversion:** Up to 49% across all three entities
- **Full conversion window:** 18 months from funding
- **Declining equity schedule:** After month 18, equity decreases proportionally with interest received
- **Maturity:** 5 years
- **Founder early repayment right:** After 18 months, founders may repay in full to terminate conversion rights

This structure gives Pablo institutional-grade downside protection (secured debt with 9% coupon) and significant upside (49% equity in a venture projected to reach $229M enterprise value).

---

## 7. Deposit Security Mechanism

### The Requirement

A $1.7M deposit (approximately 10% of total capital) must be secured before closing to:
- Lock the property with the seller
- Fund preliminary due diligence
- Begin entity formation and legal structuring
- Demonstrate commitment to all parties

### Recommended Mechanism: Escrow with Milestone Release

This is the cleanest, most institutional approach. It protects Pablo completely while giving the founders the ability to execute.

### Protections

**For Pablo (Investor):**

| Protection | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| Funds held by neutral third party | Escrow agent has fiduciary duty to both parties |
| Release requires documented milestones | No funds released without satisfying specific conditions |
| Full return if deal collapses | If any milestone is not met within the defined timeline, remaining escrow funds return to Pablo in full |
| Break-fee protection | If founders terminate without cause after Milestone 2 (property deposit placed), Pablo receives return of all escrow funds plus a break fee equal to 2% of committed capital ($346,000) to cover opportunity cost |
| Due diligence costs | Each party bears its own due diligence costs. If Pablo terminates after satisfactory due diligence, he bears his costs but receives remaining escrow in full. |
| Transition to full security | Upon full funding and property closing, the $1.7M deposit rolls into the first-position lien securing the full $17.3M note |

**For Founders:**

| Protection | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| Ability to lock property | Milestone 2 releases $1.2M to secure the property with the seller |
| Due diligence cost coverage | Milestone 1 releases $200K for entity formation and legal work |
| Protection against investor withdrawal | If Pablo withdraws after Milestone 1 funds are released and spent on legal/formation costs, those costs are non-refundable (they were spent on shared structuring). The break-fee clause provides symmetry. |
| Timeline clarity | Each milestone has a defined timeline. If Pablo delays funding the escrow, the founders can pursue other capital. |

### Lien Attachment Timeline

| Event | Security Status |
|-------|----------------|
| Escrow funded | Escrow agent holds funds under fiduciary duty. Pablo has contractual right to return under escrow terms. |
| Milestone 2 — property deposit placed | Pablo has contractual right to the property deposit (via escrow agreement). Not yet a lien on the property. |
| Full funding + property closing | First-position lien attaches to PropCo's fideicomiso beneficial interest. Share pledge on PropCo shares executed. Full security package in place. |
| Conversion event | Lien releases completely. Pablo becomes 49% equity owner. |

## 8. Risk Analysis

### CFC Risk (Controlled Foreign Corporation)

**Risk Level: LOW (by design)**

| Factor | Analysis |
|--------|---------|
| Rule | A CFC exists when U.S. shareholders (each owning 10%+) collectively own >50% of a foreign corporation |
| Pablo's ownership | 49% — he is a "United States shareholder" under IRC 957 |
| Other U.S. shareholders | Nicholas invests via Panama Foundation; Jason via Cook Islands Trust. **Neither is a U.S. person for this purpose** (assuming non-U.S. tax residency). |
| Total U.S. ownership | 49% — below the 50% threshold |
| **Result** | **HoldCo is NOT a CFC.** Pablo is not subject to Subpart F current inclusion. |

**Critical assumption:** Nicholas and Jason are not U.S. persons (citizens, residents, or green card holders). If either is a U.S. person, their ownership would be attributed through their offshore structures, potentially pushing total U.S. ownership above 50%. **Verify with tax counsel.**

**Mitigation if CFC status applies:** If the HoldCo were a CFC, Pablo would face current U.S. taxation on certain "Subpart F income" (passive income, foreign personal holding company income). Active business income from the operations would generally not be Subpart F income. The primary exposure would be on royalty income and passive investment income. Even in a CFC scenario, the structure remains functional — it just loses some tax deferral benefit.

### PFIC Risk (Passive Foreign Investment Company)

**Risk Level: MODERATE — requires active management**

| Factor | Analysis |
|--------|---------|
| Rule | A PFIC exists if (a) 75%+ of income is passive, OR (b) 50%+ of assets produce passive income |
| Income test | If HoldCo's income is primarily management fees (active) from OpCo and the margin retained from client payments (active facilitator role), the income should be predominantly active. Royalties received from IP Co licensing are a concern — royalties are generally passive. |
| Asset test | HoldCo's largest asset is its ownership of PropCo (real estate — passive). This is a risk factor. |
| **Risk** | **The HoldCo could be a PFIC in years where the real estate asset dominates the balance sheet and before operations generate significant active income.** |

**Mitigation strategies:**

1. **Ensure HoldCo has genuine active business operations.** HoldCo should employ or contract for management, marketing, and platform operation services. It should not be a passive shell.
2. **Look-through rules.** Under the PFIC "look-through" rule, if HoldCo owns 25%+ of a subsidiary, the subsidiary's income and assets are attributed to HoldCo on a proportional basis. Mexico OpCo's active income and operating assets help HoldCo pass the PFIC tests.
3. **QEF election.** If HoldCo is a PFIC in any year, Pablo should make a Qualified Electing Fund (QEF) election. This converts the punitive "excess distribution" regime into current-year inclusion of Pablo's pro-rata share of HoldCo's earnings. Less favorable than non-PFIC status but far better than the default PFIC regime.
4. **Annual PFIC determination.** Pablo's U.S. tax counsel must perform an annual PFIC analysis. HoldCo should provide the financial data needed for this determination.

### BEPS Risk (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting)

**Risk Level: MODERATE — manageable with proper documentation**

| BEPS Action | Relevance | Mitigation |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Action 5 (Harmful Tax Practices) | Cayman is not on the EU blacklist and participates in OECD transparency standards | Structure is compliant by jurisdiction choice |
| Action 6 (Treaty Abuse) | No treaty benefits being claimed (Cayman has no tax treaties) | Not applicable — no treaty shopping |
| Actions 8-10 (Transfer Pricing) | The margin split between HoldCo, OpCo, and IP Co must reflect genuine value creation | Commission a transfer pricing study from a recognized firm. Document all intercompany transactions at arm's length. |
| Action 13 (Country-by-Country Reporting) | May apply if consolidated revenue exceeds EUR 750M | Not applicable at current scale. Monitor as revenue grows. |
| Action 7 (PE Status) | Mexico OpCo must not be deemed a PE of the Cayman HoldCo | Structure OpCo as independent contractor, not agent. OpCo bears its own commercial risk. See PE analysis below. |

### PE Risk (Permanent Establishment in Mexico)

**Risk Level: MODERATE-HIGH — requires careful structuring**

| Factor | Analysis |
|--------|---------|
| Risk | If Mexico determines that Cayman HoldCo is "carrying on business in Mexico" through OpCo, the HoldCo's global income could be subject to Mexican tax |
| Triggers | OpCo acting as a dependent agent of HoldCo; HoldCo having a "fixed place of business" in Mexico; HoldCo personnel making decisions in Mexico |
| Mitigation | (1) OpCo contracts with HoldCo as an independent service provider, not as an agent. (2) OpCo bears genuine commercial risk (it can lose money on a given engagement). (3) HoldCo's management decisions are made outside Mexico. (4) HoldCo employs or contracts for personnel outside Mexico. (5) Board meetings held outside Mexico. (6) All intercompany agreements explicitly define the independent contractor relationship. |

**The facilitator model** (HoldCo contracts with guests, subcontracts clinical services to OpCo) creates PE risk if not properly structured. Mexican tax authorities have been increasingly aggressive about asserting PE status on foreign entities with Mexican operations.

**Alternative approach (lower PE risk):** OpCo contracts directly with guests for clinical services. HoldCo provides management and marketing services to OpCo for a fee. IP Co licenses technology and protocols to OpCo for a royalty. This approach reduces HoldCo's PE risk in Mexico but shifts more revenue (and therefore tax) to Mexico.

**Recommendation:** Discuss both models with Mexican tax counsel. The facilitator model retains more profit offshore but carries higher PE risk. The management-fee model is safer but less tax-efficient. The right choice depends on Mexican counsel's current read of SAT enforcement posture and recent precedent.

### Regulatory Risk

| Domain | Risk | Mitigation |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Mexican medical licensing | OpCo must hold all required medical and facility licenses. Ibogaine is legal in Mexico but clinical use requires proper medical oversight. | Engage Mexican healthcare regulatory counsel. Obtain all licenses before opening. |
| Mexican foreign investment | PropCo and OpCo must register with RNIE. Foreign ownership of Mexican entities triggers notification requirements. | Standard compliance — include in entity formation scope of work. |
| U.S. regulatory | Ibogaine is a Schedule I controlled substance in the U.S. Marketing to U.S. clients must be carefully structured to avoid facilitating illegal activity. | HoldCo markets "wellness and transformation" experiences. OpCo provides medical services under Mexican law. Legal counsel should review all marketing materials. |
| Data protection | Cross-border health data transfer triggers compliance obligations in multiple jurisdictions. | Implement GDPR-standard data governance from day one. See Section 4 for detailed framework. |
| Anti-money laundering | $17.3M cross-border investment will trigger AML/KYC requirements at multiple points (banks, escrow, entity formation). | Standard institutional KYC for all parties. Budget time for bank compliance processes. |

## 9. Conservative vs. Optimized Model Comparison

### Conservative Model

**Philosophy:** Minimize risk. Accept higher tax cost in exchange for structural simplicity and maximum defensibility.

| Element | Conservative Approach |
|---------|---------------------|
| HoldCo jurisdiction | Delaware LLC (pass-through) — eliminates CFC, PFIC, and PE risk entirely. Pablo reports all income currently. |
| Entity count | 2 entities (Delaware LLC + Mexico OpCo). IP held within the LLC. No separate PropCo. |
| Revenue flow | All revenue flows through Mexico OpCo. LLC receives management fee only (10-15%). |
| IP location | Within the Delaware LLC or Mexico OpCo. No offshore IP entity. |
| Tax outcome | Pablo pays current U.S. tax on all income. Mexico takes 30% on OpCo income. Total effective tax: 40-50%+ on all revenue. |
| Deposit | Simple escrow with U.S. law firm. |
| Complexity | Minimal. Two entities. One jurisdiction (plus Mexico). |
| Risk | Very low. No international tax planning risk. No BEPS scrutiny. No PE issues. |

**Total estimated annual tax on $14,000/week/guest at 50 guests/year (steady state):**
- Gross revenue: ~$36.4M
- Total tax: ~$14.5-$18.2M (40-50%)
- Net retained: ~$18.2-$21.9M

### Optimized Model (Recommended)

**Philosophy:** Legally minimize tax while maintaining full compliance and institutional credibility. Accept moderate complexity in exchange for significant tax efficiency.

| Element | Optimized Approach |
|---------|-------------------|
| HoldCo jurisdiction | Cayman Islands — zero local tax, non-CFC with 49% U.S. ownership, institutional credibility. |
| Entity count | 4 entities (Cayman HoldCo + Mexico PropCo + Mexico OpCo + Cayman IP Co). Clean separation of asset classes. |
| Revenue flow | HoldCo receives client payments. OpCo receives 60-70% as service fee. IP Co receives 10-20% as royalty. HoldCo retains 10-30%. |
| IP location | Cayman IP Co — maximum protection, zero local tax, global licensing capability. |
| Tax outcome | Mexico: 30% on OpCo net income + 25% withholding on royalties. Cayman: 0%. Pablo: deferred until distribution/exit. |
| Deposit | Institutional escrow with milestone release. |
| Complexity | Moderate. Four entities. Two jurisdictions (plus Mexico). Requires annual PFIC analysis and transfer pricing documentation. |
| Risk | Moderate. Requires proper substance, transfer pricing study, and ongoing compliance. |

**Total estimated annual tax on same revenue base:**
- Gross revenue: ~$36.4M
- Mexico OpCo tax: ~$4.5-$6.5M (30% on net income of $15-$22M)
- Mexico withholding on royalties: ~$0.9-$1.8M (25% on $3.6-$7.3M royalties)
- Cayman tax: $0
- Pablo U.S. tax: deferred (significant value)
- Total current tax: ~$5.4-$8.3M (15-23%)
- Net retained (before Pablo's deferred U.S. tax): ~$28.1-$31.0M

### Comparison Summary

| Factor | Conservative | Optimized | Advantage |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Annual tax rate | 40-50% | 15-23% (current) | Optimized saves $9-$10M/year on $36M revenue |
| Structural complexity | Low (2 entities) | Moderate (4 entities) | Conservative is simpler |
| Compliance cost | ~$30-$50K/year | ~$100-$200K/year | Conservative is cheaper to maintain |
| IP protection | Weak (IP in operating jurisdiction) | Strong (IP isolated in Cayman) | Optimized protects the most valuable asset |
| Asset segregation | None | Full (RE, Ops, IP separated) | Optimized enables independent exits |
| Scalability | Limited (restructuring needed to expand) | High (IP licensing model scales globally) | Optimized built for growth |
| Investor credibility | High (simple and transparent) | High (institutional-grade, standard international structure) | Both acceptable |
| Defensibility | Very high (nothing to challenge) | High (with proper documentation) | Conservative is safer |
| 5-year tax savings | Baseline | ~$35-$50M in deferred/reduced tax | Optimized generates transformational value |

### The $100K Question

The optimized structure costs approximately $100-$200K/year more in compliance, accounting, and legal fees than the conservative structure. It saves $9-$10M/year in tax on a $36M revenue base.

The annual compliance investment represents less than 2% of the annual tax savings.

## 10. Clear Final Recommendation

### The Structure

**Implement the Optimized Model** — Cayman HoldCo with three operating subsidiaries (Mexico PropCo, Mexico OpCo, Cayman IP/Data Co).

This is not the simplest possible structure. It is the *simplest structure that adequately protects the IP asset, provides meaningful tax efficiency, and scales internationally.* Removing any entity from the stack sacrifices something material:

- Remove IP Co → IP exposed to Mexican liability and suboptimal tax treatment
- Remove PropCo → Real estate commingled with operational risk
- Collapse to single HoldCo → No asset segregation, no independent exit paths
- Move to Delaware → Lose all tax deferral, ~$35-$50M cost over 5 years

### The Jurisdiction

**Cayman Islands** for the HoldCo and IP entity. **Mexico** for PropCo and OpCo. No additional jurisdictions needed. Panama and Cook Islands are used only for the founders' personal holding structures (already established).

The three-jurisdiction layering concern (Panama + Cook + Cayman) is addressed: Panama and Cook Islands are the founders' personal vehicles, not part of the corporate structure. The corporate structure uses only Cayman and Mexico. Clean, two-jurisdiction architecture.

### The Deposit

**Institutional escrow with milestone release.** Pablo wires $1.7M to a neutral escrow agent. Funds release in three tranches tied to documented milestones. Full return if deal collapses. Break-fee protection if founders terminate.

### The IP

**Separate Cayman entity, GDPR-standard data governance, cloud infrastructure outside Mexico.** The neurological dataset is the generational asset. Protect it accordingly.

### The Tax Flow

**60-70% to Mexico OpCo (service fee), 10-20% to IP Co (royalty), 10-30% retained by HoldCo.** Commission a Big 4 transfer pricing study before operations begin. Do not rely on informal margin estimates.

### Immediate Next Steps

| Step | Action | Timeline | Responsible |
|------|--------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Engage Cayman Islands corporate counsel for HoldCo and IP Co formation | Week 1 | Founders |
| 2 | Engage Mexican counsel for PropCo, OpCo formation and fideicomiso | Week 1 | Founders |
| 3 | Execute escrow agreement and fund $1.7M deposit | Week 2 | Pablo + Founders |
| 4 | Engage U.S. tax counsel for Pablo's PFIC analysis and QEF election planning | Week 2 | Pablo |
| 5 | Commission transfer pricing study | Week 3-4 | HoldCo (once formed) |
| 6 | Complete property due diligence | Week 2-8 | All parties |
| 7 | Form all entities and establish fideicomiso | Week 4-10 | Counsel |
| 8 | Close property acquisition | Week 10-14 | PropCo |
| 9 | Begin renovation and medical facility buildout | Post-closing | OpCo + PropCo |
| 10 | Begin platform and data infrastructure development | Post-closing | IP Co |

### The Mission

Pablo, Nicholas, and Jason are building something that does not yet exist in the world: a luxury medical transformation center powered by the most advanced AI health intelligence system on the planet, sitting on a generational neurological dataset that will reshape how we understand consciousness, addiction, and healing.

The structure exists to serve that mission. It protects the partners, protects the patients, protects the data, and creates the conditions for this venture to scale from a single property in Tulum to a global platform.

The architecture is clean. The jurisdictions are credible. The tax efficiency is defensible. The IP is protected. The investor is secured. The deposit mechanism is institutional.

Now build it.
