# THE FACE OF REGENERATIVE DEVELOPMENT
## 5-Slide Version

---

## SLIDE 1: THE PROBLEM

**You have 15 entities. Nobody sees the category.**

15+ projects across real estate, climate, arts, philanthropy.

All of it real. None of it connected.

Right now, people see: **"Interesting projects"**

What they should see: **"Tony Cho = Regenerative Development"**

---

**The gap is not the work.**

**The gap is: nobody sees you as the category owner.**

---

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
- Don't explain the problem. He knows it.
- Just name it clearly: "15 entities. Nobody sees the category."
- Pause. "The gap is not the work. The gap is: nobody sees you as the category owner."
- Move on.

## SLIDE 3: WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE

**Vishen owns Personal Transformation.**

**You own Regenerative Development.**

---

**When you own the category:**

✓ **Conference organizers call you first** — keynotes, not panels

✓ **Publications reference you as the authority** — the category definer

✓ **Investors know your name before your projects** — capital starts with you

✓ **Every initiative amplified** — book, development, speaking = ecosystem distributes it

✓ **$12M raise flows naturally** — infrastructure shows the complete picture

---

**From:** "Developer with projects"

**To:** "The face of Regenerative Development"

---

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
- "Vishen owns Personal Transformation. You own Regenerative Development."
- Pause. Let that land.
- "Here's what that looks like."
- Read each bullet. Don't elaborate.
- Pause at the transformation line.
- "That's what we build."

## SLIDE 5: THE DEAL

**Why this deal is structured this way:**

Typically, we charge 30% upfront. This engagement is different.

We believe in you being the authority for regenerative development. The movement needs a leader who can take it where it needs to go. We want to help you get there.

This is more mission than transaction for us.

**Let us help you become institutional-ready.**

---

**$40K starts the build. 90% deferred.**

| | What You Pay |
|---|---|
| **Upfront** | $40,000 (10% vs. typical 30%) |
| **When $1.2M raised** | $180,000 |
| **When $3.6M raised** | $180,000 |
| **Total Cash** | $400,000 (3.3% of $12M raise) |
| **Our Equity** | $400,000 (vests when raise closes) |
| **Future Work** | At cost (no margin) |

**What you get:**
- ChoVerse ecosystem (all 15 entities)
- Category ownership positioning
- $12M raise infrastructure
- Institutional-ready business and future
- Long-term partnership

---

**The question is not whether we can put you there.**

**The question is whether you're ready to sit there.**

---

**When you're ready, we're here.**

---

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
- "Typically we charge 30% upfront. This is structured differently."
- "We believe in you being the authority for regenerative development."
- "The movement needs a leader. We want to help you get there."
- "This is more mission than transaction for us."
- Pause.
- "Let us help you become institutional-ready."
- Show the table. "$40K starts — 10% instead of our typical 30%."
- "90% deferred. Equity vests when raise closes. Future work at cost."
- Pause.
- "The question is not whether we can put you there."
- Pause.
- "The question is whether you're ready to sit there."
- Silence. Wait for response.
